# About The Project
This project aims to solve the daily challenges faced by the people, who are unable to speak (dumb) or the ones who have recently undergone an accident and are temporarily unable to speak. It can also be used by elderly people, who find difficulty in speaking.
With this wearable hand assistant glove, dumb people or patients can easily communicate by just tapping the points on the glove by their thumb that results in 12 different commands that are both audible audio and image on any Android smartphone via. an application. This can also be used in automation of day to day gadgets like home appliances and many more.
